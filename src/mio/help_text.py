repeat_help_text = """Moore.io Repeat (!) Command
   Repeats last command ran by mio.  Currently only supports the `sim` command.
   
Usage:
   mio ! CMD [OPTIONS]
   
Options:
   -b, --bwrap  Does not run command, only creates shell script to re-create the command without mio and creates a
                tarball of the project outside the project root directory.  Currently only supports `sim` command.
   
Examples:
   mio sim uvmt_example -t rand_stim -s 1 ; mio ! sim -b  # Run a simulation for `uvmt_example` and create a tarball
                                                          # that can be run by anyone using only bash."""




sim_help_text = """Moore.io Sim(ulation) Command
   Performs necessary steps to run simulation of an IP.  Only supports Digital Logic Simulation for the time being.
   
   While the controls for individual steps (FuseSoC processing, compilation, elaboration and simulation) are exposed, it
   is recommended to let `mio sim` manage this process as much as possible.  In the event of corrupt simulator
   artifacts, see `mio clean`.  Combining any of the step-control arguments (-F, -C, -E, -S) with missing steps can
   result in unpredictable behavior and is not recommended (ex: `-FS` is illegal).
   
   Two types of arguments (--args) can be passed: compilation (+define+NAME[=VALUE]) and simulation (+NAME[=VALUE]).
   
   For running multiple tests in parallel, see `mio regr`.
   
Usage:
   mio sim IP [OPTIONS] [--args ARG ...]
   
Options:
   -t TEST     , --test      TEST       Specify the UVM test to be run.
   -s SEED     , --seed      SEED       Positive Integer. Specify randomization seed  If none is provided, a random one will be picked.
   -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity VERBOSITY  Specifies UVM logging verbosity: none, low, medium, high, debug. [default: medium]
   -e ERRORS   , --errors    ERRORS     Specifies the number of errors at which compilation/elaboration/simulation is terminated.  [default: 10]
   -a APP      , --app       APP        Specifies simulator application to use: viv, mdc, vcs, xcl, qst, riv. [default: viv]
                                        WARNING: Only Vivado is currently supported. VCS and Metrics will be added in the
